They are four main types of JOIN in SQL:

1. INNER JOIN (return matching values)
2. LEFT JOIN (all the records from the left table and matching records from right table)
3. RIGHT JOIN (all the records from the right table and matching records from left table)
4. FULL JOIN (return recors where there's a match in either table)

SQL JOIN clauses have two sides:

- LEFT is the table we selected FROM
- RIGHT is the table we JOIN WITH
